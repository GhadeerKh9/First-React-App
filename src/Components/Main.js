             <img src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/markhor.jpg" alt="" />
             <p>The markhor, according to ARKive, lives in the mountains of central Asia, adeptly climbing craggy rocks with the grace of North America’s own mountain goat</p>

             <h1>Saiga</h1>
             <img src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/saiga.jpg" alt="" />
             <p>Native to the dusty steppes of Kazakhstan, Russia, and sometimes Uzbekistan during migrations, the saiga is a truly absurd-looking and delightful antelope.</p>



             <h1>Nubian Ibex</h1>
             <img src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bharal.jpg" alt="" />
             <p>he Nubian ibex’s gigantic, backward-curling horns are even more impressive when you consider that the ibex uses them to smash into male competitors while on top of scary mountains in North Africa and Arabia.</p>
